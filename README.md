#jQuery UI Bootstrap 3

This project was started to bring the beauty and ease-of-use of Twitter Bootstrap to jQuery UI widgets â™¥.

##Why?

Bootstrap is one of our favorite projects, but having used it regularly it left us wanting two things:

* The ability to work side-by-side with jQuery UI (something which caused a number of widgets to break visually)
* The ability to theme jQuery UI widgets using Bootstrap styles. Whilst we love jQuery UI, we find some of the current themes to look a little dated. Our hope is that this theme provides a decent alternative for others that feel the same.

To clarify, this project doesn't aim or intend to replace Twitter Bootstrap. It merely provides a jQuery UI-compatible theme inspired by Bootstrap's design. It also provides a version of Bootstrap CSS with a few (minor) sections commented out which enable the theme to work along-side it.

We welcome any and all feedback as we would very much like this theme to be as solid as possible.

##Browser-support

All modern browsers are targeted by this theme with 'lo-res' experiences (i.e no gradients, border-radius etc.) provided for users using older browsers. 

There *are* some minor known issues lingering that I'm working on, but the hope is that in time those will all get ironed out. 

##jQuery UI support

This theme targets jQuery UI 1.10.3 and the default version of jQuery included in the (current) jQuery UI builds (jQuery 2.0.3).
